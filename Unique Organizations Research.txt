Name: San Estaban Mining Company
ID: ORG_SEMINE
Kind: Chilean mining company dedicated to the production of copper and gold
History:
Began operations in the San Jose Mine in 1889 but the company was not officially founded until 1957 but a Hungarian immigrant named Jorge Kemeny Letay.
Became notoriously known in the mineral-rich region and has had 8 workers die while working in their mines along with a number of fines for safety breaching.
The San Jose Mine which is owned by the company was closed in 2007 when relatives of deceased workers sued the company but was reopened in 2008 even though it failed to comply with regulations.
The company has a history of ignoring warnings and worker lawsuits of unsafe working conditions and many believe that were it not for this the event could have been avoided.

Name: Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
ID: ORG_FCLATT
Kind: Church
History:
The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church, known to some as Mormon Fundamentalists) is one of the largest fundamentalist denominations[3][4] and one of the largest organizations in the United States whose members practice polygamy.[5] The FLDS Church emerged in the early twentieth century when its founding members left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's suspension of the practice of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate its members who would continue the practice.
The FLDS Church is estimated to have 6,000 - 10,000 members residing in the sister cities of Hildale, Utah and Colorado City, Arizona; Eldorado, Texas; Westcliffe, Colorado; Mancos, Colorado; Creston and Bountiful, British Columbia; and Pringle, South Dakota.[6] There are also developing communities near Benjam√≠n Hill, Sonora (south of Nogales in the state of Sonora) and Ensenada, Baja California (south of Tijuana). n 2003, the church received increased attention from the state of Utah when police officer Rodney Holm, a member of the church, was convicted of unlawful sexual conduct with a 16- or 17-year-old and one count of bigamy for his marriage to and impregnation of plural wife Ruth Stubbs. The conviction was the first legal action against a member of the FLDS Church since the Short Creek raid.
