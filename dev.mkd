Conventions we are using for python:
 1. No [Hungarian Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation)
 2. Variable names are camelCase.  Please do not use underscored_variable names
 3. No limit line length
 4. Class names will be camel case with the first letter capitalized
 
        class CamelCaseClass:
            pass
