Companies associated with the film and theater, Warner Bros. and Cinemark, donated a great amount of time to aid the families of the victims.

Key Person: 
Key Organization: San Esteban Mining Company 
Kind: Natural Disaster 
Date and Time: August 5, 2010 
Locations: Copiapo in northern Chile, South America 
Human Impact: 
The country had just experienced an earthquake and tsunami earlier that year, so news of the workers predicament garnered much empathy from the population of Chile which led the national governments take over of search and rescue attempts. 
Government and international efforts to rescue the miners were greatly driven by the empathy and passion felt by the population of Chile and those around the world who expressed their sympathy. 
Economic Impact: 
$20 Million dollars were spent on the several rescue plans implemented in an attempt to save the miners, with a third of that coming from private donations and the rest coming from the government and mine owners. 
Resources Needed: 
The Government first used a Strata 950 model raise borer drilling rig to create an escape shaft but this plan was halted due to the danger falling rock debris. 
They then used a Schramm Inc. T130XD air core drill, to widen one of the holes created by the previously used drill rig but was unfortunately wrecked upon hitting a metal bar in an old working, which was then followed by wearing out of the second drill. 
The third and last attempt involved a Canadian made RIG-421 oil drilling rig which was able to drill large deep holes at faster rate than the mining drills. 
Cooperation and resources of companies and individuals came from around the world such as Latin America, South America, United States and Canada, with developmental aid coming from NASA specialists. 
Ways to Help: 
Miners have already been rescued but donations can probably still be made to an organization associated with helping the miners.

NON-UNIQUE CRISIS


Name: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
Key Person: Prime Minister Naoto Kan
Key Organization: Operation Tomodachi, Red Cross

Kind: Natural Disaster
Date and Time: 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on 11 March 2011
Locations: Japan

Human Impact:  
15,883 deaths, 6,145 injured, and 2,671 people missing. 
129,225 buildings totally collapsed, with a further 254,204 buildings 'half collapsed', and another 691,766 buildings partially damaged. Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without wate. 
The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents.
Of the 13,135 fatalities recovered by 11 April 2011, 12,143 or 92.5% died by drowning. Victims aged 60 or older accounted for 65.2% of the deaths, with 24% of total victims being in their 70s. 
As of March 2012, Japanese police data showed that 70% of the 3,279 still missing were aged 60 or over, including 893 in their 70s and 577 in their 80s. Of the total confirmed victims, 14,308 drowned, 667 were crushed to death or died from internal injuries, and 145 perished from burns.

Economic Impact: 
Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. 
The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history. 
By 12 April 2011 the Japanese government estimated that the cost of just the direct material damage could exceed ¥25 trillion ($300 billion).

Resources Needed: 
Evacuation shelters faced a shortage of potable water, food, blankets and bathroom facilities, as the government arranged these necessities to be delivered to where they were needed from areas of Japan and abroad. 
Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan announced that the government had mobilized the Japan Self-Defense Forces in earthquake disaster zones. He asked the Japanese public to act calmly and tune into media for updated information. He reported that numerous nuclear power plants were automatically shut down to prevent damage and releases of radioactivity. He set up emergency headquarters in his office to coordinate the government's response.
