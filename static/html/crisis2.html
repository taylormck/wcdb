        <h4>Kind</h4>Mass Shooting 

        <h4>Date and Time:</h4>July 20, 2012 12:30 AM 

        <h4>Locations:</h4>Aurora, Colorado, United States 

        <h4>Human Impact:</h4>
        Twelve people were killed at a multiplex Cinemark theater in Aurora Colorado during the midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises. 
        This incident was considered the deadliest shooting since The Columbine massacre on April 20, 1999. 
        Several other incidents followed this one at other theaters where several other men were arrested for acts of violence or attempting to carry through with an act of violence. 
        The Presidential Candidates at the time, Barrack Obama and Mitt Romney, suspended campaign advertising and visited victims at Hospitals. 
        Actor Christian Bale along with other sports teams visited several victims and expressed their condolences. 
        There was a great fear that similar incidents would occur in cinemas across the United States and the world resulting in an increase in security in cinemas throughout the country. 
        This once again brought the issue of gun control to the surface of news and politics.

        <h4>Economic Impact:</h4>
        The Organization The Community First Foundation received substantial donations from Warner Bros. to aid the victims of the shooting. 
        The theater where the incident occurred was shut down for months before reopening on January 2013, resulting in a great loss for the theater owners. 
        Funeral expenses incurred by the victim's families was paid for by Cinemark. Gun sales in Colorado, Washington, Florida, and several other states grew tremendously after the incident along with an increase in background checks.

        <h4>Resources Needed:</h4>
        Cinemas and theaters around the world began hiring more employees to fill out the roles needed in their security increase. 
        Companies associated with the film and theater, Warner Bros. and Cinemark, donated a great amount of time to aid the families of the victims.

        <h4>Ways to Help:</h4>
        Donations can still provided to the Comunity First Foundation for the families of the victims of the incident. 
        Be warry of specific people entering theaters. 
        Cooperate with theater employees by not wearing suspicious looking clothing or bringing any possible weapon props to events they might be holding.

        2010 Copiago Mining Accident 
        Key Person: 
        Key Organization: San Esteban Mining Company 
        Kind: Natural Disaster 
        Date and Time: August 5, 2010 
        Locations: Copiapo in northern Chile, South America 
        Human Impact: 
        The country had just experienced an earthquake and tsunami earlier that year, so news of the workers predicament garnered much empathy from the population of Chile which led the national governments take over of search and rescue attempts. 
        Government and international efforts to rescue the miners were greatly driven by the empathy and passion felt by the population of Chile and those around the world who expressed their sympathy. 
        Economic Impact: 
        $20 Million dollars were spent on the several rescue plans implemented in an attempt to save the miners, with a third of that coming from private donations and the rest coming from the government and mine owners. 
        Resources Needed: 
        The Government first used a Strata 950 model raise borer drilling rig to create an escape shaft but this plan was halted due to the danger falling rock debris. 
        They then used a Schramm Inc. T130XD air core drill, to widen one of the holes created by the previously used drill rig but was unfortunately wrecked upon hitting a metal bar in an old working, which was then followed by wearing out of the second drill. 
        The third and last attempt involved a Canadian made RIG-421 oil drilling rig which was able to drill large deep holes at faster rate than the mining drills. 
        Cooperation and resources of companies and individuals came from around the world such as Latin America, South America, United States and Canada, with developmental aid coming from NASA specialists. 
        Ways to Help: 
        Miners have already been rescued but donations can probably still be made to an organization associated with helping the miners.
