World Crisis Database
=====================
A website to gather and share data of crises around the world.

This is a school project, the details of which can be found [here](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/downing/cs373/drupal/wcdb1).
Our assignment is simple.
Create a website that compiles and shares data of world crises.  We list the individual crises, show some fact-checked information, and list information about people and organizations involved.
This will help keep the public informed about the going-ons of the world and help them get in touch with the right people to make a difference.
